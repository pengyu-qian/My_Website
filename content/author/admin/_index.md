I am a final year Ph.D. student in the Decision, Risk and Operations division at Columbia Business School. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Yash Kanoria](http://www.columbia.edu/~yk2577/). 

I will be on the **2020-2021 academic job market**.

My research interest lies in the optimal control of **stochastic networks** that arise in **marketplaces**, and **market design**.

You can reach me at _pq2124 at columbia dot edu_.
