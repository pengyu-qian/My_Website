I am on the **2020-2021 academic job market**. Schedule of my talks at the virtual INFORMS 2020 Annual Meeting is [here](https://pengyuqian.netlify.app/#talks).

I am a final year Ph.D. student in the Decision, Risk and Operations division at Columbia Business School. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Yash Kanoria](http://www.columbia.edu/~yk2577/). 

<!-- My research interest lies in the optimal control of **stochastic networks** that arise in **marketplaces**, and **market design**. -->

My research studies networked marketplaces with an emphasis on online decision-making, using tools from applied probability and modern optimization. I am interested in foundational theoretical models motivated by problems in revenue management and pricing, and matching markets. My research emphasizes algorithms and mechanisms that not only have good theoretical guarantees, but also are simple, robust, and hence practical for real-world systems.
